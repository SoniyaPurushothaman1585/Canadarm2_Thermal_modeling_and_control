# Canadarm2 Thermal Control System Project

## 🛰️ Overview
This project models and analyzes the thermal control system for Canadarm2, focusing on:

- Passive and active thermal regulation strategies
- Orbit-induced environmental loads
- Simulation of transient and steady-state temperatures
- Verification against defined performance requirements

It follows a **Systems Engineering lifecycle** from requirements to testing.
