## 1. General System Requirements

**REQ-001:**  
The Thermal Control System (TCS) shall maintain all Canadarm2 critical components within specified temperature limits during all mission phases, including nominal operations, standby, and maneuvers.

**REQ-002:**  
The TCS shall operate effectively under the thermal environment experienced in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) aboard the ISS, accounting for orbital sunrise/sunset cycles (~90-minute period).

**REQ-003:**  
The TCS shall provide both active and passive thermal control methods, including heaters, radiators, insulation, and thermal coatings, to manage temperature fluctuations.

**REQ-004:**  
The TCS shall interface with Canadarm2’s Command and Data Handling system to allow monitoring and control of thermal states.

## 2. Environmental and Thermal Loads

**REQ-005:**  
The TCS shall be designed to handle external thermal loads from solar radiation, Earth albedo, and Earth infrared radiation as per ISS orbital parameters.

**REQ-006:**  
The TCS shall accommodate induced thermal loads caused by internal heat dissipation from Canadarm2 electronics, motors, and actuators.

**REQ-007:**  
The TCS shall withstand and maintain functionality during thermal vacuum conditions as expected in the ISS environment.

## 3. Performance and Safety

**REQ-008:**  
The system shall maintain critical component temperatures within a safe range, typically between -40°C and +60°C, unless otherwise specified by subsystem requirements.

**REQ-009:**  
The TCS shall provide real-time temperature data with a resolution of at least ±1°C for thermal management decisions.

**REQ-010:**  
The system shall automatically adjust heater power or other active controls to prevent overcooling or overheating without manual intervention.

## 4. Verification and Validation

**REQ-011:**  
The TCS design shall be validated through thermal analysis simulations and thermal vacuum (TVAC) testing replicating LEO conditions.

**REQ-012:**  
Thermal performance test plans shall include transient and steady-state conditions replicating orbital thermal cycles.

---

## 5. Interfaces and Constraints

**REQ-013:**  
The TCS hardware shall be compatible with existing Canadarm2 mechanical interfaces and electrical power budgets.

**REQ-014:**  
The system shall comply with ISS safety and operational standards, including electromagnetic compatibility and controlled goods regulations.
