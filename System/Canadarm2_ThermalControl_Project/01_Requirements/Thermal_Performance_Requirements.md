# Thermal Performance Requirements — Canadarm2 TCS

## 1. Scope
Defines performance-specific requirements to ensure Canadarm2 remains within operational temperature limits.

## 2. Thermal Design Constraints

| ID | Requirement Description |
|----|--------------------------|
| THERM-001 | All components shall remain within their specified survival and operational temperature ranges. |
| THERM-002 | The TCS shall maintain thermal gradients below 20°C across structural elements to prevent stress. |
| THERM-003 | The system shall respond to thermal changes within 5 minutes of detection. |
| THERM-004 | Heater power shall not exceed 50W at any time. |
| THERM-005 | Simulation error for predicted temperature shall not exceed ±5°C of test measurements. |
| THERM-006 | The system shall function across a range of -40°C to +60°C (environmental extremes). |

## 3. Environmental Inputs
- Solar flux: ~1367 W/m²
- Earth IR and albedo values per NASA standards
- Spacecraft surface emissivity/absorptivity: customizable
