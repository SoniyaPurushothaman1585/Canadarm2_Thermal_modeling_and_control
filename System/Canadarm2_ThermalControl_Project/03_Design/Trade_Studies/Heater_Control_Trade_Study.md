# ðŸ”¬ Heater Control Strategy Trade Study

## 1. Objective
Evaluate different heater control strategies for Canadarm2's thermal system and select the optimal approach based on performance, simplicity, and power efficiency.

## 2. Candidate Options

| Strategy       | Description                                       | Pros                           | Cons                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Bang-Bang      | On/Off control with threshold hysteresis          | Simple, low resource use       | Less precise, can oscillate    |
| PID Controller | Proportionalâ€“Integralâ€“Derivative logic            | Precise control                | Requires tuning, complex       |
| Time-based     | Periodic heater cycling based on orbit position   | Predictable power draw         | No real-time adaptation        |
| Rule-based     | Uses logic rules (e.g., eclipse mode = ON)        | Customizable, scenario-based   | May miss dynamic changes       |

## 3. Evaluation Criteria
- Power efficiency  
- System stability  
- Ease of integration  
- Fault tolerance  
- Performance in thermal vacuum (TVAC)

## 4. Recommendation
Use a hybrid Bang-Bang + Rule-Based control strategy:
- **Bang-Bang** for temperature threshold regulation
- **Rules** for special conditions (eclipse entry, payload heating)

This balances performance and simplicity while remaining fault-tolerant and low-power.
