# Interface Control Document (ICD) â€“ Canadarm2 Thermal Control System

## 1. Purpose
This Interface Control Document (ICD) defines all critical interfaces between the Canadarm2 Thermal Control System and external/internal systems. It supports configuration management, subsystem integration, and verification.

---

## 2. Scope
Applies to the active/passive thermal control elements of Canadarm2 that operate aboard the International Space Station (ISS), including heaters, sensors, and structural thermal paths.
