# Thermal Architecture Overview â€“ Canadarm2 Thermal Control System

## 1. Introduction

This document presents the thermal architecture of the Canadarm2 Thermal Control System (TCS). It describes how thermal loads are managed in the space environment, how components are thermally protected, and how the system integrates with the International Space Station (ISS) for operational functionality.

## 2. Objectives

- Maintain component temperatures within operational and survival ranges
- Handle orbital thermal cycling (eclipse and sunlit phases)
- Protect electronics, sensors, joints, and mechanical links
- Interface reliably with ISS power and telemetry systems
- Support fault-tolerant thermal control

---

## 3. System Context

Canadarm2 operates on the exterior of the ISS, exposed to:

- Vacuum and microgravity
- Large temperature swings (â€“150Â°C to +120Â°C)
- Limited conductive paths
- Radiative-only heat rejection to space or optional ISS radiator coupling

## 4. ðŸ”§ Thermal Control Strategy

### 4.1 Passive Control Methods
- **Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI):** Reduces radiative heat transfer between components and to space.
- **Thermal Coatings:** Surface treatments to control absorptivity/emissivity ratios.
- **Component Placement:** Optimize layout to isolate thermally sensitive hardware.
- **Thermal Isolation Mounts:** Prevent unwanted conduction from hot to cold components.
- **Heat Pipes / Thermal Straps (if applicable):** Conduct heat from hot areas to radiative surfaces.

### 4.2 Active Control Methods
- **Resistive Heaters:** Used in joints, electronics boxes, and end effectors.
- **Temperature Sensors (RTDs/Thermistors):** Monitor local temperatures in real time.
- **Control Logic:** Simple on/off control or PID regulation based on sensor input.
- **Power Management:** Draws 28V DC from ISS power bus, with defined max draw limits.
- **Health Monitoring:** Heater current and temperature profiles logged via telemetry.
